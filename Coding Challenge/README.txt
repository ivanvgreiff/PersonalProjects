I have added 2 extra files since I turned in my work the first time: 
--> ChallengeB_q2_oppositeVotes.py 
--> ChallengeB_q3_againstMajority.py


^-- Both of these files work correctly, and are meant to replace the OLD file which does NOT work namely challengeB_q2_directblockchain.py (I would have deleted this but in the PDF of my answers I sent, it mentions this file and not the 2 new ones...)


Therefore, as of 28.03.2025 here is the UPDATED list of the python files belonging to each challenge:

Challenge A:
--> challengeA_q2_1_directblockchain.py
--> challengeA_q2_1_subgraph.py

Challenge B:
--> ChallengeB_q2_oppositeVotes.py
--> ChallengeB_q3_againstMajority.py

Challenge C:
--> ChallengeC_q1_tokenOrg.py
--> ChallengeC_q1_pseudoRevenue.py
--> ChallengeC_q2_pseudoProfit.py
