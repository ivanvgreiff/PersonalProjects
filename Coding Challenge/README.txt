I have added extra files since I turned in my work the first time, these are improved versions with no errors: 
Challenge A:
--> challengeA_q1_isVulnerableDAO.py
--> challengeA_q2_estimateCost.py
Challenge B:
--> ChallengeB_q2_oppositeVotes.py
--> ChallengeB_q3_againstMajority.py


^-- Both of these files work correctly, and are meant to replace the OLD files which does NOT work as well namely challengeB_q2_directblockchain.py, challengeA_q2_1_directblockchain.py, challengeA_q2_1_subgraph.py 
(I would have deleted these but in the PDF of my answers I sent, it mentions these files and not the new ones...)


Therefore, as of 28.03.2025 here is the UPDATED and FINAL list of the python files belonging to each challenge:

Challenge A:
--> challengeA_q1_isVulnerableDAO.py
--> challengeA_q2_estimateCost.py

Challenge B:
--> ChallengeB_q2_oppositeVotes.py
--> ChallengeB_q3_againstMajority.py

Challenge C:
--> ChallengeC_q1_tokenOrg.py
--> ChallengeC_q1_pseudoRevenue.py
--> ChallengeC_q2_pseudoProfit.py
