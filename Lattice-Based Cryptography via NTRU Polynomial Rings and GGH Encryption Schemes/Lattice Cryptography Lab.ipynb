    "Let us consider a setting in which you need to remember a passphrase $\\mathbf{m} = (m_1,m_2,m_3,m_4) \\in \\mathbb{F}^4$. The size of each message symbol is $8$ bit. As you do not want to learn your passphrase by heart, you think of simply storing it on a USB drive. However, it may happen that you lose the drive. Therefore, you decide to employ a McEliece-Sarwate secret sharing scheme and distribute the information about your passphrase to $6$ distinct USB drives. If you lose one of the drives, a person who finds it should not be able to reconstruct your passphrase.\n",
